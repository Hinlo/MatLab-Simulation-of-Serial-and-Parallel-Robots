# MatLab-Simulation-of-Serial-and-Parallel-Robots
This repository contains MatLab simulations of inverse kinematics for a 5 DoF serial robot arm and a 3 DoF parallel robot. It contains trajectory and obstacle avoidance examples for the serial robot as well as forward kinematics and workspace plotting. It contains workspace plotting for the parallel robot.
